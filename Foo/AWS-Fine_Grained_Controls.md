# OpenShift - AWS Installation using Fine Grained Controls

GOAL(s):  

*  Try to figure out exactly what perms are needed to do the install
*  Are those same permissions needed to *manage* the cluster? (updates, adding functionality)
*  Are those same permissions needed to run the cluster? (auto-scaling of Nodes, etc...)
*  What is Red Hat's recommendation?
